<p> <a name="Security Mindset"> <h2> Security Mindset </h2>
<br>
The <em> Security Mindset </em> is a way of thinking which emphasises the fallability or holes in a system.  </a>
</p>

<p> <a name="Reasons for Security"> <h2> Reasons for Security </h2> </a>

Security needs to be put in place in order to ensure <em> Confidentiality, Integrity and Availabilty <b>"CIA"</b> </em> of data.  
<br>
	<b> Confidentiality </b> refers to the protection of data from unauthorised third parties.
<br>
	<b> Integrity </b> means data is kept as it is supposed to be and unwanted changes are corrected and/or prevented (i.e. it is not corrupted). 
<br>
	<b> Availability </b> ensures data can be accessed at any time and from any location by authorised people.
<br>
<br>
	Security is neccessary to protect people and assests from potential harm such as financial loss or legal consequences due to data theft or identity theft for example.
<br> 
	Security provides assurance that people's assets as well as legal, professional and social personalities are protected. 
<br>
	It therefore facilitates trust between interacting parties and promotes legal compliance as upholds good governance.

<p> <a name="Methods of Security"> <h2> Methods of Security </h2> </a>

Security involves implementing and reinforcing the <em> "3 A's" </em> in order to ensure accountability regarding the use of information systems:
<br>
<br>
	<em><b>A</b>uthentication</em> (Biometrics, Passwords, Tokens)
<br>
	<em><b>A</b>uthorisation</em> (Access control)
<br>
	<em><b>A</b>udit</em> (Forensic analysis, Detection of intruders)

<p> <a name="Controls"> <h2> Controls </h2>  </a>
</p>

	<em> Controls </em> are security measures which are implemented to mitigate risk. There are 3 broad categories of controls . . .
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li> Physical <br> Infrastructures such as cameras, gates, guards and locks which prevent outsiders coming into contact with valuable assets.   </li>
		<br>
		<li> Logical <br> Technical features such as encryption, firewalls and passwords which prevent unauthorized activities.   </li>
		<br>
		<li> Administrative <br> Laws, policies and procedures which govern interaction   </li>
		<br>
	</ul>

	<tr>
		<td> Simplicity of design and implementation of security measures </td> 
		<td> Default configurations should have conservative protection scheme </td>
		<td> Security architecture and/or design should be publicly available </td>

<br>
<!-- Try to set all this info in an iframe later -->

<p> <a name="Viruses"> <h3> Viruses </h3> </a>
	
	<br>
	Harmful code developed by attackers which causes destruction to the system. <br> Viiruses can be planted into systems or may spread via email and/or (removable) disks.
</p>
	

<br>

<p> <a name="Trojan Horses"> <h3> Trojan Horses </h3> </a>
	
	<br> 
	Malicious programmes or software code disguised inside a safe- or normal-looking programme. 
	<br>
	When a user runs the programme, the disguised code runs aas well, deleting files and/or corrupting the computer. 
	<br>
	(Usually spread via email attachments)
</p>
		<img src="Images/Trojan horse.jpg" width="200" height="200" />

<br>

<p> <a name="Worms"> <h3> Worms </h3> </a>
	
	<br> 
	Programs which run independently; travelling from computer to computer accross network connections.
	<br> 
	Segments of the worms may be running on multiple computers simultaneously. They usually do not change other programs but may transport code which does.
</p>


<br>

<p> <a name="Password Cracking"> <h3> Password Cracking </h3> </a>
	
	<br> 
	A technique used by attackers to secretly gain access to a system through a third party user's account.
	<br>
	This is usually achieved through abuse of or theft of trusted or personal information. 
</p>

<br>


<p> <a name="Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks"> <h3> Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks </h3> </a>
	
	<br>
	This is an attack in which hackers flood a Web server with communication in order to keep it pre-occupied or 'break' the system which results in loss due to the compromised neccessity of having the service available.
</p>

<br>


<p> <a name="Email Hacking"> <h3> Email Hacking </h3> </a>
	
		
	

  <h4> Impersonation </h4> 
	
	<em> Impersonation </em>: The sender address on internet email cannot be trusted as the sender can create a false return address. 
	<br> 
		It is possible for someone to have modified the header in transit, or for the sender to have connected directly to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (STMP) port on the target computer to enter the email.

<br>

  <h4> Eavesdropping </h4> 
	<em> Eavesdropping </em>: Email headers and contents get transmitted in plain text if no encryption is used. 
	<br> 
		This means that the contents of a message can be read or altered in transit. 
	<br>
		It is possible to modify the header to hide por change the sender, or to redirect the message. 
</p>
	<img src="Images/Mail virus.png" width="200" height="200" />


<br>

<p> <a name="Packet Replay"> <h3> Packet Replay </h3> </a>
	<br>
	<em> Packet Replay </em>: Message packets in a network can be recorded and retransmitted. This is a significant threath for programmes which use authentication sequences <b> as 
		intruders are able to replay legitimatenauthentication sequence messages to gain access to a system. Packet replay is generally almost impossible to detect; however, it can be <b>
	prevented using packet time-stamping and packet sequence counting.
</p>


<br>

<p> <a name="Social Engineering"> <h3> Social Engineering </h3> </a>
<br>
	<em> Social Engineering </em>: This is a common form of cracking which can be used by those external to or internal to an organisation. It is a method in which hackers coax people into <br> 
	erroneously revealing their password or confidential security information.
</p>


<br>

<p> <a name="Intrusion Attacks"> <h3> Intrusion Attacks </h3> </a>
<br> 
	<em> Intrusion Attacks </em>: Intrusion attacks involve hackers using hacking tools such as password-cracking tools or manipulation tools <br>
	in order to gain access to closed systems. Intrusion detection tools can detect changes and variants which take place within a system or network; and have been effective in deterring intruders.
</p>


<br>

<p> <a name="Network Spoofing"> <h3> Network Spoofing </h3> </a>
<br>
	<em> Network Spoofing </em>: In network spoofing, a system presents itself to the network as though it were a different system (computer A impersonates computer B by sending B's address instead of its own).
	<br> This is done in order for the intruder to gain entry into  an otherwise closed group of trusted systems. Trust is imparted in a one-to-one manner: computer A trusts computer B (this does not mean computer B trusts computer A)
	<br> Additionally, it is taken for granted that the system administrator  of the trusted system is performing its job properly by maintaining an appropriate level of security for the system. 
	<br> The opportunity arises for network spoofing to work in the following way: computer A trusts computer B and computer C spoofs (impersonates) computer B, allowing computer C to gain access to computer A, a system it would otherwise have been excluded from.

<p> The use of Cryptocurrencies is becoming more popular amongst the general public; which would suggest a trend towards greater online security risks with greater potential losses due to cybercrime becoming a legitimate concern for the individual person.
	<br> This means we should see greater investments in personal online security in the near future. The following video provides an outlook on the future of computer security, with a particular emphasis on protection and safe use of cryptocurrency.
